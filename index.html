            <p>Rock, paper, scissors (also known as Rochambeau, Roshambo, <br>
                or Janken)is a fun and easy hand game that anyone can learn and enjoy. <br>
                It’s a great way to make minor decisions when you and a friend can’t agree on something,<br>
                 or even just an entertaining way to pass the time. <br>
                 The neat thing about the game is that almost anybody can pick the rules up in a matter of seconds. <br>
                In this article, 
                   we’ll break the game down so that you and a friend can play whenever you’d like.</p>

    <p>Rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, and paper beats rock.</p>
