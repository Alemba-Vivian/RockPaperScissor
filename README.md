CREATED A SIMPLE ROCKPAPERSCISSORS
After learning about javascript DOM, I created a simple game called RockPaperScissor using
HTML,CSS and Scissors. It is a basic application whereby the user plays with the computer
The computer randomly picks rock, paper or scissors - same to the user whenever the rock, paper, scissors button is clicked. I have implemented whatever I have learnt so far and I am proud of myself.
After 5 rounds of play, The winner is declared with the highest number of points
